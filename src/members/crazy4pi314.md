I'm Dr. Sarah Kaiser and I love everything about quantum technology!

As a [Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5003652) for the Q# programming language + the Quantum Development Kit, I love showing people how easy it is to program a quantum computer. 
Join me on Twitch on Tuesdays to AMA about quantum computing, and work with me on Wednesdays and Saturdays on open source Q# projects on Quantum Develop with Me stream ðŸ’–
Also, drop by [qsharp.community](https://qsharp.community), and learn how to develop for quantum technologies with a welcome and friendly community.

When not at the keyboard I love laser cutting everything (safe), writing [books about engineering](amazon.com/author/sckaiser) for kids and adults, as well as playing with my pup, [Chewie](https://twitter.com/chewieborka).
